I am an AI researcher passionate about advancing natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning technologies to enhance and positively impact people's lives. I work at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (ranked 14th in AI globally) under supervision of Prof.~Timothy Baldwin and Prof. Preslav Nakov on urgent problems of \textbf{AI safety}: model reliability and fairness. I lead a research team that develops robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques to efficiently tackle LLM hallucinations. The team has created the most comprehensive UQ library for LLMs: [LM-Polygraph](https://github.com/IINemo/lm-polygraph).
Our research aims to increase the applicability of AI technologies in safety-critical areas, such as healthcare and finance.
