I am an AI researcher passionate about advancing natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning technologies to enhance and positively impact people's lives. I work at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence: MBZUAI (ranked 14th in AI globally) under supervision of Prof. Timothy Baldwin and Prof. Preslav Nakov on urgent problems of **AI safety: model reliability and fairness.** 

I lead a research team that develops robust uncertainty quantification (UQ) techniques to efficiently tackle LLM hallucinations. The team has created the most comprehensive UQ library for LLMs: [LM-Polygraph](https://github.com/IINemo/lm-polygraph).
Our research aims to increase the applicability of AI technologies in safety-critical areas, such as healthcare and finance.

Based in [Abu Dhabi, UAE](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uFErwJwPkSqTUbyz9), I welcome collaborations and discussions on these topics.
